The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start helps to ensure that new AWS accounts enrolled by AWS Control Tower are integrated with New Relic. {partner-product-short-name} allows you to monitor your AWS data in the New Relic database, which acts as a single source of truth for operational data. {partner-product-short-name} is built atop NRDB, which allows you to manage and visualize data.

For a list of integrations and data you can collect, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list[Amazon integrations^].

{partner-product-short-name} integrations for AWS must be delegated using an IAM role and associated managed policy. IAM role permissions permit the {partner-product-short-name} AWS account to retrieve telemetry data from your AWS account. For more information, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies[Integrations and managed policies^].
