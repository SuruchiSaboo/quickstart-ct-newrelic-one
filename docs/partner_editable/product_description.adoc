The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start allows you to streamline the observability
of your AWS accounts with New Relic. With this solution, whenever a new AWS account is enrolled,
it's automatically integrated with your New Relic account using the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/[New Relic AWS integrations]. You can then manage all your AWS operational data and insights from one place, with
no need to hop back and forth between multiple AWS accounts or other set of observability tools.

New Relic AWS integrations require you to grant New Relic permission to read operational telemetry data from your AWS account. This is achieved by using an AWS IAM role, referred to as “New Relic Integration”, that uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html[AWS IAM cross-account access]. New Relic AWS integrations uses the Amazon CloudWatch API to collect telemetry data for the AWS services you monitor. For details on the IAM Role and Policy that supports these integrations, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies[Integrations managed policies].
