The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start helps to streamline the observability of AWS accounts with New Relic. When you enroll a new AWS account, it's automatically integrated with your New Relic account using https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/[New Relic AWS integrations^]. You can manage all of your AWS operational data and insights from one place without toggling between accounts and observability tools.

{partner-product-short-name} requires that you grant read permission to operational telemetry data from your AWS account. To do this, use an AWS IAM role that uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html[AWS IAM cross-account access^]. {partner-product-short-name} uses the Amazon CloudWatch API to collect telemetry data for your monitored AWS services.
