==== Clean up AWS CloudFormation

Time to complete clean up will vary based on how many AWS accounts is included in your {partner-product-name} deployment. CloudFormation stack deletion may timeout and it's safe to retry it.

. Open the AWS CloudFormation console, and delete the {partner-product-name} base stack to clean up all AWS resources deployed by the Stack and StackSet. This action will also delete all StackSet instances, which include IAM role deployed on each linked AWS account. 
. After base stack is deleted, navigate to AWS CloudFormation https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacksets[StackSet]. Search for New Relic stackset and confirm the StackSet has been deleted.

==== Uninstall New Relic AWS Integration

Ensure that AWS CloudFormation clean up has been completed before you proceed. New Relic IAM roles will be removed by now and you are not required to login to each AWS account to delete it.
