=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. Navigate to the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{partner-product-short-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[Getting started^].

. When the subscription process completes, exit AWS Marketplace without further action.

IMPORTANT: Do not provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing AWS account, ensure your AWS account is enrolled in AWS Control Tower. This Quick Start does not support deployments into accounts from organizations outside of AWS. Ensure that your list of existing AWS accounts are comma delimited (for example, `account_id_1,account_id_2,account_id_3`). 

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete. Note that the deployment time is greater if you deploy this Quick Start in an existing AWS account.
