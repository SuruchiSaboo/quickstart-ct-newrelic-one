This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} with existing AWS accounts*. This option deploy the CloudFormation StackSet, Lambda functions, IAM roles and SNS. It then deploy {partner-product-short-name} into each existing AWS accounts that you specify as parameter. The solution will launch automatically on future newly vended AWS accounts.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} without existing AWS accounts*. This option deploy the CloudFormation StackSet, Lambda functions, IAM roles and SNS. The solution will launch automatically on future newly vended AWS accounts.

The Quick Start uses single templates for these options. It lets you enter the comma-delimited list of AWS accounts that you wish to include in the launch.
