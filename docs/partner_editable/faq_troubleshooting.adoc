*Q.* What data analytics does New Relic provide?

*A.* New Relic provides a real-time analytics platform that collects metrics, events, logs, and traces from your production software, infrastructure, and services. New Relic transforms the data into actionable items for your stack, business, and customers.

*Q.* Can I add additional, external data to New Relic?

*A.* Yes. New Relic is an open platform that allows you to send metrics, events, logs, and traces from third-party sources. For example, you can use custom events to store data that is unavailable during a page view, server transaction, or mobile session. 
//TODO Need links/sources for the following statement.
Learn more about how New Relic supports open instrumentation to ingest metrics data from Prometheus, tracing data instrumented with Zipkin, or logs data from Fluentd.

*Q.* What is the data-retention period for queried events?

*A.* Data retention varies with the type of data (metrics, events, logs, and traces) and is generally up to you. New Relic has customizable data-retention settings, so, in some cases, you can retain data for as long as necessary. The price of storage is determined by the amount of stored data, so choose a retention period (where applicable) that meets your business and budgetary needs.

*Q.* Can I extract data from New Relic?

*A.* Exporting data from New Relic is available via New Relic's API or JSON code, which is provided with each chart, graph, and dashboard.

*Q.* How much does New Relic cost?

*A.* Pricing depends on the New Relic product you use. For example, New Relic offers host-based pricing for the New Relic infrastructure product, which is required for AWS integrations. For more information, https://newrelic.com/about/contact-us[Contact New Relic^].

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is in the AWS CloudFormation console under *Advanced* on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.) Lastly, inspect for errors the Amazon CloudWatch logs for the AWS Lambda function `NewRelicOnboardingFunction`.

*Q.* I included a list of AWS accounts in the deployment, but no AWS integrations are shown in the New Relic console.

*A.* Ensure that your list includes only AWS account IDs that are managed by AWS Control Tower. Also verify that your New Relic NerdGraph API key is correct and has the required permission to set up an AWS integration. Inspect the Amazon CloudWatch logs for errors triggered by the Lambda function `NewRelicRegisterFunction`.

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.
*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].
